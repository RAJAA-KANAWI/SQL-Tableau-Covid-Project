# COVID-19 Data Exploration with SQL  
### Portfolio Project – SQL Analysis

This project demonstrates how to perform exploratory data analysis on COVID-19 datasets using **SQL Server**. The data includes COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations across different countries and continents. The goal is to extract insights on infection rates, mortality, vaccination progress, and trends over time.

## Data Source
- **COVID-19 Deaths Dataset**  
- **COVID-19 Vaccinations Dataset**  
- Source: [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)  
- Database: `PortfolioProject`  
- Tables:
  - `CovidDeaths`
  - `CovidVaccinations`

## Key Concepts & Queries Used

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Filtered out rows with null values in the `continent` column to exclude regions like cruise ships or unknown locations.

### 2. Basic Exploration
- Selected key columns like `location`, `date`, `total_cases`, `total_deaths`, `population`.
- Ordered data to understand how the pandemic evolved in each country.

### 3. Mortality Analysis
```sql
(total_deaths / total_cases) * 100 AS deathpercentage
```
- This shows the likelihood of dying after contracting COVID-19.

### 4. Infection Rate Analysis
```sql
(total_cases / population) * 100 AS infectionrate
```
- Shows what percentage of a country’s population contracted COVID.

### 5. Countries with Highest Impact
- Used `GROUP BY` and `MAX()` to identify:
  - Countries with the highest infection count.
  - Countries with the highest death toll.

### 6. Continental Aggregation
- Breakdown of total deaths by continent.

### 7. Global Stats
- Aggregated global total cases, deaths, and calculated overall mortality rate.

## Vaccination Analysis

### Vaccination Progress by Country
Used `JOIN` between `CovidDeaths` and `CovidVaccinations` on `location` and `date`.

```sql
SUM(new_vaccinations) OVER (PARTITION BY location ORDER BY date) AS rollingpeoplevaccinated
```
- Calculated cumulative vaccination count per country over time.

### Percentage of Population Vaccinated
Created a temporary table `#percentagepopulationvaccinated` to store:
- Population
- New vaccinations
- Rolling total of vaccinated people
- % of population vaccinated

### View Creation
Saved the logic as a view for easy visualization access:
```sql
CREATE VIEW percentagepopulationvaccinated AS ...
```
